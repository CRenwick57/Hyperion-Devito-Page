                        The world's first billion dollar actor, Danny Devito has been charming audiences and making women swoon for decades. Known for his
                        characteristic growl and mighty 4'11" frame, Devito is a phenomenon that science has yet to explain.

                        The entity we now know of as Daniel Gawain Starchild Devito Esq. was first photographed in 1944, skulking around atomic test sites.
                        J. Robert Oppenheimer spotted him rifling through the garbage of the Manhatten Project and began laughing hysterically. Shortly after,
                        the newly christened "Danny Devito" (so named for a character in the Bhagavad Gita that Oppenheimer had actually misremembered) was headed
                        straight for Hollywood.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Devito quickly found superstardom in Hollywood and within 1 week he was starring in his first feature film. After two weeks he had been fired
                        from that film for the excessive cocaine habit he'd picked up from standing within 6 feet of Judie Garland.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By the 1980s he'd sobered up, and was ready for some great parts, such as Twins, Friends, Matilda, and eventually his biggest success yet: It's
                        Always Sunny in Philadelphia, which has been running seemingly interminably since the God damn Bush administration
